# baromino

An attempt at modelling the famous and honorable game of Kingdomino, in order to implement various AI strategies of different levels of sophistication. A spiritual successor to my [struggle](https://github.com/paavohuhtala/struggle) project, and similarly inspired by [tom7's work on bad chess AI](http://tom7.org/chess/weak.pdf).
